=head1 NAME

Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial - Generate multinomial samples
using the conditional binomial method.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial;

    my $object = Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial->new(
        data => [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4],
    );
    $object->draw;
    #  returns a number between 0..3

    my $samples = $object->draw_n_samples(5)
    #  returns an array ref that might look something like
    #  [3,3,0,2,0]
    
    $object->draw_with_mask([1,2]);
    $object->draw_n_samples_with_mask([1,2]);
    #  locally set data at positions 1 and 2 to zero
    #  so they will have zero probability of being returned

    # to specify your own PRNG object, in this case the Mersenne Twister
    my $mrma = Math::Random::MT::Auto->new;
    my $object = Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial->new(
        prng => $mrma,
        data => [1,2,3,5,10],
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements multinomial sampling using the conditional binomial method
(the same algorithm as used in the GSL).
Benchmarking shows it to be faster than the Alias
method implemented in L<Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial::AliasMethod>,
presumably because the calls to the PRNG are inside XS and avoid
perl subroutine overheads
(and profiling showed the RNG calls to be the main bottleneck
for the Alias method).  

For more details and background about the various approaches,
see L<http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item my $object = Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial->new(data => [0.1, 0.4, 0.5], data_sum_to_one => 1)

=item my $object = Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial->new (data => [1,2,3,4,5,100], prng => $prng)

Creates a new object, optionally passing a PRNG object to be used.

Callers can promise the data sum to one, in which case it will not calculate the sum.
No checks of the validity of
such promises are made, so expect failures for lying.
(This should be generalised to use the sum directly).

If no PRNG object is passed then it croaks.
One day it will default to an internal object
that uses the perl PRNG stream and has a binomial method.

Passing your own PRNG means you have control over the random number
stream used, and can use it as part of a separate analysis.
The only requirement of such an object is that it has a binomial()
method.

=item $object->draw

Draw one sample from the distribution.
Returns the sampled class number (array index).

=item $object->draw_n_samples ($n)

Returns an array ref of $n samples across the K classes,
where K is the length of the data array passed in to the call to new.
e.g. for $n=3 and the K=5 example from above,
one could get (0,1,2,0,0).


=item $object->update_values (1 => 10, 4 => 0.2)

Updates the data values at the specified positions.
Argument list must be a set of numeric key/value pairs.
The keys and values are not otherwise checked,
but the system will follow perl's rules
regarding non-numeric values under the warnings pragma.
The same applies for floating point array indices.

=item $object->draw_with_mask ($aref)

=item $object->draw_n_samples_with_mask ($n, $aref)

These locally mask out a subset of classes by setting
their probabilities to false.  In many cases this will
(should) be faster than generating a new object with
the subset excluded, especially if that new object is
then discarded.  

=item $object->get_class_count

Returns the number of classes in the sample,
or zero if initialise has not yet been run.

=item $object->get_data

Returns a copy of the data array.  In scalar context
this will be an array ref.

=item $object->get_sum

Returns the sum of the data array values.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
L<https://github.com/shawnlaffan/perl-statistics-sampler-multinomial/issues>.

Most tests are skipped on x86 as Math::Random::MT::Auto seeds differently
and thus the PRNG sequences differ between x86 and x64.


=head1 SEE ALSO

These packages also have multinomial samplers and are (much) faster than
this package, but you cannot supply your own PRNG.
If you do not care that all your random samples come from the same PRNG stream
then you should use them.
