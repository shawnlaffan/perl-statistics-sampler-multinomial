Revision history for Statistics-Sampler-Multinomial

0.86 20201023
  - A few micro-optimisations

0.85 20201020
  - Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial: Add update_values, get_data, and get_sum methods
    AliasMethod is unchanged.  

0.84 20200930
  - Add draw_with_mask and draw_n_samples_with_mask to Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial

0.83 20200909
  - Modify Statistics::Sampler::Multinomial->draw method

0.82 20180915
  - add license meta, thanks MANWAR

0.81 20180915
  - use same version across pm files

0.8 20180915
  - micro-optimisation in S::S::M::draw_n_samples

0.7 20170219
  - See if we can avoid more test failures on some systems,
    this time due to planning twice errors.

0.6 20170218
  - Test changes only
  - Check $Config{ivsize} to determine if we should skip.
    The archname tests missed too many cases.

0.5 20170217
  - Skip most tests on x86 architectures, as Math::Random::MT::Auto
    generates different PRNG streams for a given seed compared with x64
    (unless it is an x86 long int build).

0.4 20170216
  - No functional changes from the 0.3_00x dev releases
  - Document that Alias method results will differ between
    double and long double builds

0.3_004 20170214
  - Skip some tests on long double builds

0.3_003 20170214
  - Shift to a tolerance based test (avoid sprintf)

0.3_002 20170214
  - Set minimum perl version to 5.014

0.3_001 20170214
  - See if we can get more insight into cpan testers fails
  - Add explicit return to cuckoo packages
  - Add checks for PRNG sequences
